v0.4.4 - 13/05/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Certain quoting for the check command will cause the wrong return code -
strip the quotes from start and end.
* Perl error when the script starts up under ExaBGP

v0.4.3 - 13/05/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Changes to interval, rise/fall values and logcheck values were not
being reloaded correctly.
* Certain changes that resulted in a configuration error that was detected
when reloading the config resulted in no further changes being applied.
* If the configuration file disappeared during a certain time (eg. it was
removed) it would cause the script to crash.

v0.4.2 - 13/05/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fix the process name - if the service was rising or falling it may not
be updated in some cases.
* Many configuration file reload enhancements:
- All IP's are not withdrawn and announced again when they don't need to be
- If there were multiple configuration file changes, not all of them were
applied correctly - only some changes may have been applied.
- If the next hop IP was changed and the service was in the down state, it
was not being applied when the service came back up.
- The whole configuration reload part of the script has been cleaned up so
that it isn't handled differently depending on the current service status.

v0.4.1 - 12/05/16
------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
* Use the Data::Validate::IP module for validating IP addresses. The
nexthop IP and any IP's to announce are validated to ensure that they
are valid and belong to the same address family. If there is a mask
specified they are also validated.
* If no netmask is specified for IP's to be announced, default to /32
or /128.

v0.4 - 09/05/16
------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
* Add version option to script - call ./healthcheck.pl -v to get version.
* Change log file added.
* Extra debug logging added - if debug=yes is set for the service and the
list of IP's configured for the service is changed, the old and new IP's
will be logged to the debug log file.

BUG FIXES
* If the configuration file is edited to change the IP's announced, when
it is reloaded automatically the changed IP is not detected. This only
affects IP changes that have the same number of IP's as before the
change. The script now requires the Perl module Array::Utils.

v0.3 - 29/04/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fix error when re-reading configuration file due to changes due to
incorrect arguments passed to validate_config().

v0.2 - 22/04/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fix typos in help output/readme

v0.1 - 21/04/16
------------------------------
* Initial release to GitHub
