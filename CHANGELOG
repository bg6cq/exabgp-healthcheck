v0.4 - 09/05/16
------------------------------
NEW FEATURES
* Add version option to script - call ./healthcheck.pl -v to get version.
* Change log file added.
* Extra debug logging added - if debug=yes is set for the service and the
list of IP's configured for the service is changed, the old and new IP's
will be logged to the debug log file.

BUG FIXES
* If the configuration file is edited to change the IP's announced, when
it is reloaded automatically the changed IP is not detected. This only
affects IP changes that have the same number of IP's as before the
change. The script now requires the Perl module Array::Utils.

v0.3 - 29/04/16
------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fix error when re-reading configuration file due to changes due to
incorrect arguments passed to validate_config().

v0.2 - 22/04/16
